MAGE ENGINE PROCEDURE:
    1. The game has two different run modes, Release and Dist
        1.1. Release mode is meant to be used during game development
        1.2. Dist mode is only meant to distribute the .mageproj file
    2. First handle the game opening
        2.1. If the game is built in Dist mode, no inputs are accepted
        2.2. If the game is built in Release mode, first check if a run command was provided
            2.1.1. If a run command wasn't provided, just handle the argument
            2.1.2. Else, first check whether a file path was given to the engine
                2.1.2.1 If no path was provided, search for main.wren in the current directory
                2.1.2.2 If a run path was provided, set it as the base directory for the project
                        and find main.wren there.
